//rule hv.X.1 {
//	caption "High voltage source/drain regions must be tagged by diff:hv"
//}

//rule hv.X.3 {
//	caption "High voltage poly can be drawn over multiple diff regions that are ALL reverse-biased by at least 300 mV"
//	caption "(existence of reverse-bias is not checked by the CAD flow). It can also be drawn over multiple diffs when"
//	caption "all sources and all drain are shorted together. In these case, the high voltage poly can be tagged with "
//	caption "the text:dg label with a value 'hv_bb'. Exceptions to this use of the hv_bb label must be approved by technology."
//	caption "Under certain bias conditions, high voltage poly tagged with hv_bb can cross an nwell boundary. "
//	caption "The poly of the drain extended device crosses nwell by construction and can be tagged with the 'hv_bb' label." 
//	caption "Use of the hv_bb label on high voltage poly crossing an nwell boundary must be approved by technology. "
//	caption "All high voltage poly tagged with hv_bb will not be checked to hv.poly.1, hv.poly.2, hv.poly.3 and hv.poly.4."
//}

//rule hv.X.4 {
//	caption "Any piece of layout that is shorted to hv_source/drain becomes a high voltage feature."
//}

// Remaining hv rules are not coded as it is believed DRM is out-of-date
// Will be revisited in a future release
