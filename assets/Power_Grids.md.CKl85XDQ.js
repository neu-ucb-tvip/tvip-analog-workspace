An inadequately designed PDN can lead to major performance loss from static &amp; dynamic IR drops, electromigration issues, and catastrophic functional failures.</p><p>The complexity of PDN design scales with die area, power density, and operating frequency.</p><p>Generally, the structure of a power grid is a something like a tightly woven mesh network, as illustrated below:</p><img src="'+r+'" alt="power planning simple" width="600px"><p>Image source: <a href="https://www.vlsi4freshers.com/2020/01/power-planning.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.vlsi4freshers.com/2020/01/power-planning.html</a></p><p>The power grid&#39;s mesh topology is constructed from orthogonal metal layers and provides multiple low-resistance paths for VDD and VSS distribution. This minimizes voltage drops by reducing the effective distance current must travel from the power sources (e.g., C4 bumps, wirebonds) to the points of load (standard cells, macros).</p><p>The constituent stripes of the power grid are often called either &quot;power straps&quot; or &quot;power stripes&quot;.</p><h3 id="power-straps-or-power-stripes" tabindex="-1">Power straps or power stripes <a class="header-anchor" href="#power-straps-or-power-stripes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Power straps or power stripes&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Power straps are wide metal traces that form the primary horizontal and vertical conductors of the PDN mesh. They can carry substantial current across the die or within specific blocks.</p><h3 id="power-rings" tabindex="-1">Power rings <a class="header-anchor" href="#power-rings" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Power rings&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Power rings are continuous loops of wide metal, typically encircling the entire chip periphery or individual macros (e.g., memory arrays, analog blocks). They provide a robust, low-impedance VDD/VSS supply path, enhancing supply integrity for the enclosed logic. Power rings serve as a primary mechanism for <strong>electrical isolation</strong>.</p><p>Encircling a block or power domain means we can contain supply noise generated within that block and shield it from external noise coupling through the PDN. This is particularly useful in mixed-signal designs (separating analog and digital supplies) and for isolating large, noisy digital blocks from sensitive circuitry.</p><p>Multiple concentric rings or dedicated rings for specific voltage domains or sensitive analog circuitry are common techniques to further enhance isolation and support complex power management strategies.</p><h3 id="power-islands" tabindex="-1">Power islands <a class="header-anchor" href="#power-islands" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Power islands&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Power islands allow for more sophisticated power management techniques by partitioning the design into regions whose power supply (both the actual voltage level and the on/off state) can be independently controlled.</p><p>The partitioning provided by power islands is useful for:</p><ol><li><strong>Low power modes:</strong> Allowing inactive blocks to be completely powered down (via power gating using header/footer switches) or placed in a state-retention mode, drastically reducing static leakage power.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS):</strong> Permitting different blocks to operate at distinct voltage levels and frequencies optimized for their current performance requirements. This enables the concept of DVFS, which is a technique for maximizing power efficiency.</li><li><strong>Noise isolation:</strong> As mentioned with power rings, defining separate islands allows for dedicated, cleaner power supplies for sensitive blocks (e.g., PLLs, ADCs/DACs), preventing noise generated by high-activity digital logic from corrupting their operation.</li></ol><p>The concept of using rings for isolation is visualized below:</p><img src="'+s+'" alt="power planning isolation 1" width="600px"><p>In the image, distinct power islands - surrounded by power rings - can be used to isolate different IPs within a larger design. In this case, the physical designers have decided it was best to segregate the on-chip memory from other macros and IPs. These three segregated power islands are enclosed by power rings.</p><img src="'+n+'" alt="power planning ring 2" width="600px"><p>Image source: <a href="https://vlsibyjim.blogspot.com/2015/03/power-planning.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://vlsibyjim.blogspot.com/2015/03/power-planning.html</a></p><h2 id="analog-power-grid-construction" tabindex="-1">Analog power grid construction <a class="header-anchor" href="#analog-power-grid-construction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Analog power grid construction&quot;">​</a></h2><p>See the <a href="./resources/ISSCC2023-Art-of-mmWave-Layout.pdf">ISSCC 2023 Art of mmWave Layout</a> by Shahriar Shahramian from Nokia - Bell Labs.</p><img src="'+l+'" alt="mmwave layout example" width="600px"><p>Let&#39;s start by examining the contrast between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; analog/RF layout power strapping approaches. In the example provided by Shahramian, the primary distinction lies in metal density and distribution patterns.</p><p>Effective power gridding and strapping for analog/RF circuits provides:</p><ol><li>Densely interwoven VDD and VSS metal routes which intrinsically provide decoupling capacitance between power domains</li><li>Dense and evenly distributed connections from this power grid fabric to your circuit</li><li>Low-impedance paths for both DC current and high-frequency AC components</li><li>Minimal parasitic inductance in power delivery paths</li></ol><p>You want to minimize IR drop (voltage drop due to DC resistance) and reduce parasitic inductance that would be created by having sparsely strapped power connections from the grid to your circuit. Both effects become particularly problematic at high frequencies where they can introduce noise, limit bandwidth, and degrade circuit performance.</p><p>The decoupling capacitance formed by the interdigitated structure of the power grid serves as a local charge reservoir for your analog circuits. When a circuit suddenly demands current (e.g., during switching events or rapid state changes), this capacitance provides immediate charge before the distant power supply can respond, effectively filtering out high-frequency noise and stabilizing the supply voltage. For sensitive analog circuits like oscillators, ADCs, or low-noise amplifiers, this supply stability is critical for maintaining good performance.</p><img src="'+c+'" alt="mmwave isolation techniques" width="600px"><h2 id="building-blocks" tabindex="-1">Building blocks <a class="header-anchor" href="#building-blocks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Building blocks&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TODO: Sky130 Implementation Needed</p><p>The building blocks described in this section (<code>Power_Strap_Unit_Cell_m7_m8</code>, <code>decap_unit_cell</code>, and <code>power_strap_cell_[n/p]tap_unit_cell</code>) do not yet exist in this repository for the Sky130 process.

The structure interweaves VDD and VSS on m7 and m8, providing grid continuity without disrupting the underlying metal layers, active diffusion regions, or substrate.</p><p>These &quot;roof&quot; cells should be placed directly above the active circuit regions to allow the power grid to descend through vias and connect directly to the underlying layout.</p><h4 id="decap-unit-cell-decap-cell" tabindex="-1"><code>decap_unit_cell</code> Decap cell <a class="header-anchor" href="#decap-unit-cell-decap-cell" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;`decap_unit_cell` Decap cell&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Next, there is a dedicated decoupling capacitor unit cell, <code>decap_unit_cell</code>. Unlike the &quot;roof&quot; cells that are restricted to m7/m8, this decap cell utilizes ALL available layers, including active device regions such as diffusion and nwell. Within this cell, there is a MFC (Metal-Finger Capacitor) between VDD and VSS, and it handles the connection of the MFC cap to the m7/m8 straps.</p><p>You should populate any unused space in your top-level layout with these decap cells such that your circuits can benefit from a local reservoir of charge.</p><h4 id="power-strap-cell-n-p-tap-unit-cell-substrate-isolation-cells" tabindex="-1"><code>power_strap_cell_[n/p]tap_unit_cell</code> Substrate isolation cells <a class="header-anchor" href="#power-strap-cell-n-p-tap-unit-cell-substrate-isolation-cells" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;`power_strap_cell_[n/p]tap_unit_cell` Substrate isolation cells&quot;">​</a></h4><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="ntap subiso blocks" width="300px" style="display:inline-block;"> <img src="'+h+'" alt="ptap subiso blocks" width="300px" style="display:inline-block;"></p><p>Finally, there are the substrate isolation cells, <code>power_strap_cell_ntap_unit_cell</code> and <code>power_strap_cell_ptap_unit_cell</code>.

Without a well-connected grid, the rapid current demand can cause significant voltage drops and introduce supply ripple/line noise.</p><img src="'+g+'" alt="pa strapping example" width="800px">',55)]))}const P=t(m,[["render",w]]);export{q as __pageData,P as default};
